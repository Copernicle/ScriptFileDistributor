**ScriptFileDistributor** - A solution to distribute your own modpack (or just any bulk amount of files that have download links) for use among friends.
I needed a simple way to get people my modpack without actually giving them the mods. (Because of licensing.) I just wanted them to download a file, move it to a folder, and run.
The project plans to support **Windows** and **Linux** using Bash and Batch, respectively.
