**ScriptFileDistributor** - A solution to distribute your own modpack (or just any bulk amount of files that have download links) for use among friends.

I needed a simple way to get people my modpack without actually giving them the mods. (Because of licensing.) I just wanted them to download a file, move it to a folder, and run.
The project plans to support **Windows** and **Linux** using Bash and Batch, respectively. The program itself is licensed under the GPL 3.0.

This project is not yet implemented, (pre-alpha) but you can see the progress here if you're interested.
Please do not expect this to become some great project, it's just a fun, personal-scale project.
